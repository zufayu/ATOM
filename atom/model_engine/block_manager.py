    `_joint_kv_boundary` is a pure function of the prompt and the current pool

    anywhere) both legs can jointly resume, and returns this object WITHOUT
    touching the seq or any funnel counter. The caller decides whether to
    commit it -- a fit probe discards it, a real admission applies it via
    `_commit_joint_boundary`. That is what removed the `record` flag that used
    to thread down into the boundary computation: computing and recording are
    now two separate steps in two different places.

    `skip_reason is None` marks a real boundary and the four token/hash fields
    carry it; otherwise `skip_reason` names why no joint boundary was found and
    the other fields are unset. `state_from_hbm` tells the commit which tier the

        of its own, so a second request hitting the same prefix still finds it.
        How the state reaches the committed slot is the backend's
        `StateTransfer` — a fork reads the checkpoint for one forward, a copy is
        handed the bytes — and the two differ by one line here. When the pool
        cannot give a full set the request adopts the checkpoint as its
        committed slot instead: still correct, the state is exactly the one it
        wanted, it just spends the checkpoint rather than sharing it.

        A checkpoint is read-only, so several requests in one step may resume
        off the same one. The first takes it off the free list and the pin
        covers every reader until `release_state_pins`; a later one in that same
        step finds it already pinned and only needs slots to write into.
        Adopting is then off the table — the pin means someone else's forward
        still has to read it, or copy out of it.

        PAGE checkpoints gather into a fresh committed slot rather than being
        adopted: the bytes live in the KV pool, not in a state slot, so there is
        nothing here to hand over. Only fork checkpoints can be adopted.

        Whenever the gates cut a hit short, the same question is worth asking a
        second time with every ladder dense: how far would it have reached? What
        that recovers is reuse being declined only because nobody checkpointed
        there. What it does not recover is gone whatever anybody stores. The two
        land in `num_wanted_hit_blocks` (which `EngineStats` splits the declined
        reuse by) and `checkpoint_demand_pos` (which the ladder acts on).

        The demand is a rung of this seq's own, off the interval grid, and the
        seq that found the gap is the one best placed to fill it: it collects
        none of that reuse and has to compute the prefix regardless.

        Decided here, with both numbers in hand, rather than by the readers:
        `hit` survives only as `seq.num_cached_tokens`, which the scheduler
        advances as chunks land — under pipeline parallelism it is already past
        this chunk by the time `hash_blocks` runs, so a reader comparing against
        it would drop the demand on exactly the forward that was cut for it.

        A demand is not measured against the interval. The grid guesses
        where reuse will resume; a demand is reuse that was asked for and
        refused, and the granularity of the guess is no reason to discard it —
        gating one by the other left every prompt shorter than an interval
        declining all the reuse it had. The position comes from the same
        forkable test as the hit, so it always satisfies
        `num_prompt_tokens - pos >= successor_room`: somebody can really keep it.

        The shape that pays for this is a template header whose checkpoint is
        invalidated before anyone reaches it — there each request cuts a chunk
        and none collects. What bounds that is convergence rather than a
        threshold: found once, filled once, gone. `chunks_cut_for_demand`
        against `demands_recorded` is where it would show if it did not.

        `--no-state-checkpoint-demand` drops the rung and leaves the prompt-end
        anchor alone. Worth measuring: the rung is most of the write traffic
        and little of the read-back (`StateSlotPool.mark_speculative` has the
        numbers), and each write evicts something. Whether *removing* those
        writes beats merely demoting them is the open question — the CPU replay
        scores the two identically, which is the signature of a harness that
        models eviction order but not the cost of the write.

        ending there keeps: the two have to agree position for position, so the
        grid arithmetic lives here rather than at the scheduler's call site.

        Earliest, not latest, because a prompt can now want two positions and
        the chunk loop reaches the second one only by being handed the first.
        Within the grid a later rung still dominates an earlier one — one class,
        one resume point, take the rightmost — so the grid collapses to a single
        candidate before the choice is made. The prompt-end anchor is the
        exception that forces the loop: it does not dominate the rung and the
        rung does not dominate it. See `_record_checkpoint_end`.

        0 once every class that applies reads its checkpoints midstep. The cut
        exists only to put a forward's *end* on a rung, and a readable class
        does not need the end — `midstep_positions` hands it the same positions

        class still needs the forward to land there, and the readable ones lose
        nothing by being handed a position they would have taken anyway.

        A ladder of resume points, one every `state_checkpoint_interval_tokens`
        of context, shared by every class. Keeping one is capacity-neutral for a
        rolling class (the slot handed away is replaced from the free list) and
        capacity-bounded for an immutable one (an LRU-capped pin), but either
        way it costs the *keeper* an extra forward — its prompt gets cut at the
        rung — so the interval is what keeps that cost amortized instead of
        per-request.

        `next_forward_tokens` is how many tokens the forward right after this
        one carries, and is what each class's `successor_room` is compared
        against. Unset means the prompt's remainder, the prefill answer; decode
        passes one. Everything else follows from that one number — a class
        needing a long hand-over (V4's ring, 131) simply never qualifies
        mid-generation, one that hands nothing over (a retaining SWA pool, 0)
        always does, one that cannot keep a checkpoint at all (`inf`) never
        does, and a request stopping on this step passes 0 and keeps nothing
        that nothing will ever resume from.

        The position must be exact. A checkpoint holds state as of the forward's
        last token, so a forward that overshoots a rung is ahead of the hash it
        would be filed under; the scheduler cuts prefill chunks to land here,
        and a path that doesn't simply keeps nothing.

        On top of the grid sit two rungs of this seq's own.
        `checkpoint_demand_pos` is a boundary this seq was denied for want of a
        checkpoint (`_record_checkpoint_demand`); `checkpoint_end_pos` is this
        prompt's own end, which is the position agentic traffic actually resumes
        at (see `_record_checkpoint_end`). Both
        are admitted on the same terms: off the grid, and still subject to the
        `successor_room` test below — which `_record_checkpoint_end` pre-checks,
        so the cut and the keep cannot disagree. `checkpoint_cut` reads the same
        two fields, so the cut and the keep cannot drift apart.

        `aimed` says whether the caller could place the forward's end. Prefill
        can — `checkpoint_cut` shortens the chunk — so it is held to the exact
        grid and the two agree position for position. A speculative decode step
        cannot: it commits `1 + accepted`, so it steps over most rungs, and
        holding it to the grid made a decode checkpoint a one-in-`toks/fwd`
        chance. Bounding the drafts would land it there, at the price of
        throwing away speculation and under-reporting the acceptance rate,
        which counts drafts offered as `mtp_k` regardless.

        Nothing needs that price. The grid exists to space checkpoints out, and
        a step that lands on any hash-block boundary far enough past the last
        one serves the purpose exactly as well — the position only has to be
        *findable*, and a resumer finds it by hash, never by arithmetic. So an
        unaimed caller is held to the spacing rather than the grid.

        What that buys scales with how many boundaries a rung spans. A step
        lands on any given boundary with probability `1 / toks_per_forward`, so
        the chance of keeping a checkpoint per rung is
        `1 - (1 - 1/toks_per_forward) ** (interval / hash_block_size)`: at
        DeepSeek-V4's 256-token block and 4.3 tokens a forward, 23% when the
        interval is one block and effectively certain at the 8192 default. The
        two rules coincide exactly when the interval *is* the block, which is
        also the finest grid V4 admits — so a test at that setting measures
        nothing, and `demand_config` exists to avoid it.

        The demand rung is absent from that branch by construction, not by
        omission: a demand is at most the prompt's own hit ceiling, and every
        unaimed position is at or past the end of the prompt, so generation
        cannot reach one. `checkpoint_end_pos` is absent for a near-identical
        reason: it is the prompt's end stepped back to the grid, and an unaimed
        position at or past the prompt end is past it too.
