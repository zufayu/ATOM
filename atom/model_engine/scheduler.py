"""
Scheduling logic for batching prefill and decode requests.

This module provides:

- :class:`ScheduledBatch`: A frozen snapshot of sequences selected for the
  next forward pass, together with their block tables and metadata.
- :class:`ScheduledBatchOutput`: Token-level outputs from a completed batch.
- :class:`Scheduler`: The main scheduling loop that manages *waiting* and
  *running* queues, coordinates block allocation, and integrates with the
  KV disaggregation connector for remote prefill/decode.

Every scheduler here owns an :class:`~atom.model_engine.engine_stats.EngineStats`
(``self.engine_stats``); the class itself lives in ``engine_stats.py``.

    The scheduler maintains two primary queues:

    - **waiting**: Newly arrived requests pending their first prefill.
    - **running**: Active requests that have completed prefill and are
      being decoded token-by-token.

    On each :meth:`schedule` call it selects a batch of sequences that
    fit within the token and sequence budget, allocates KV cache blocks
    via :class:`BlockManager`, and returns a :class:`ScheduledBatch`.

    Integration with the KV disaggregation connector is handled through
    :meth:`_update_waiting_for_remote_kv` (decode side) and
    :meth:`_update_from_kv_xfer_finished` (both sides).

           of the ladder — otherwise the state is ahead of the hash it would be
           filed under. So land chunks on that grid (plus, at most once, a

           previous rung; `BlockManager.checkpoint_cut` owns the arithmetic, so
           that it cannot drift from the rule deciding what actually gets kept.
        2. The forward carrying a fork has to fill the request's new slot by
           itself. If the budget left a chunk too short for that, drop the fork
           rather than the request — unless the source is shared with another
           request forking off it this step, which rules out taking it over. Then
           the fork stays and the chunk is held at `min_fork_tokens` instead;
           `can_allocate` only offered a resumable boundary with that many

        - the request stops on this step, so there is nothing after it: no
          forward to fork into the slot a checkpoint would hand away, and no
          batch to issue a copy on either;
        - the seq is still on its prompt, where the prefill call site has
          already decided using the prompt's own remainder;
        - speculative decode, for a class that checkpoints by forking. Two
          reasons, and either is enough. The spec path's state index has no
          read-side counterpart (see
          `GDNAttentionMetadataBuilder.prepare_state_indices`), so a fork must
          never reach it. And a spec step commits `1 + accepted_drafts` tokens,
          which is what a fork's successor actually gets — the rest is rolled
          back and re-forwarded — so no promise made here can be kept.
          Checkpointing during *prefill* stays safe on the same models:
          `min_fork_tokens` guarantees prompt is left over, and prompt always
          forwards down the non-spec path.

        A class that checkpoints by copying is bound by none of that: the
        destination is complete when the copy lands, so any decode step will do.

        Otherwise plain decode carries exactly one token, and whether that is
        enough to fill a fresh slot is the backend's `min_fork_tokens` to say.
