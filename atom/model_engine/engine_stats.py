"""Unified engine statistics.

Holds :class:`EngineStats`, which folds in the former ``SpecStats`` and
``CacheStats`` and adds a throughput section alongside them. Kept out of
``scheduler.py`` because it is engine-level rather than scheduler-level: every
scheduler owns one, and ``engine_utility`` reads the one on the scheduler it
was handed to answer ``/debug/mtp_stats``, ``/debug/cache_stats`` and
``/metrics``.

Both P/D processes replace the scheduler that ``EngineCore.__init__`` built
the handler around, so each rewires ``utility_handler.scheduler`` to the one
it actually runs; the prefill side's snapshot then carries no ``kv_blocks_*``
keys, because the decode process owns the blocks.

    - **spec** — speculative-decoding acceptance. Logs every

      ``cache_log_interval`` requests (count-based).
    - **throughput** — engine-status summary line (running/waiting requests,
      KV usage, prefix-cache hit rate, prompt/generation throughput),
      mirroring vLLM's ``LoggingStatLogger``. Logs every
      ``throughput_log_interval_s`` wall-clock seconds (time-based)::

          Engine 000: Avg prompt throughput: 254.4 tokens/s, Avg generation
          throughput: 0.3 tokens/s, Running: 6 reqs, Waiting: 0 reqs, GPU KV
          cache usage: 0.0%, Prefix cache hit rate: 0.0%
