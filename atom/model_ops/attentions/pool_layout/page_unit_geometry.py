"""Where a checkpoint image's bytes live in the MLA paged pool.

The destination side of a K3 PAGE-copy checkpoint: given logical block (PAGE
unit) ids, it gives the addresses and tensor views of the KV pool a checkpoint
copy lands on. `_KimiMLAGDNCommon` mixes it in over `GDNStateMixin`.

Pure over `self.model_runner`, and here rather than beside that builder for the
reason the package exists (see `pool_layout/__init__.py`): the geometry deciding
where every checkpoint byte goes is then testable on a GPU-less runner, which
the K3 builder's own module -- `importorskip`ped on CI -- is not.
