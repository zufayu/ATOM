"""Index construction for the DSpark FP8 block attention path.

The fp8 draft path feeds `aiter.mla.mla_decode_fwd_v4_nm` (through
`sparse_attn_v4_paged_decode`) instead of the bf16 Triton `sparse_attn`. That
kernel addresses KV as one pool of rows plus a CSR index list per query row, so
the `[window ++ draft-block]` KV DSpark attends to has to be expressed as pool
row ids rather than a materialised `[B, W+T, 512]` tensor.

`DSparkIndexBuffers.build` fills, in one launch:

- `kv_indices` / `kv_indptr` — the ragged CSR, one query row per draft position,
  `N = B*T` rows.
- `draft_rows` — the ring rows the draft block's own KV is scattered into, fused
  into the `qk_norm_rope_maybe_quant` launch that produces it.

and `DSparkIndexBuffers.views` reads them back.

`qo_indptr` is a constant riding in the same `DSparkIndexBuffers` bundle; the
scatter's `batch_ids` is filled there too but follows how much of the batch is
real, via `mask_pad_tail`. Everything is allocated once at `max_num_seqs` and
only ever sliced, and shapes are statically known -- no `.item()`, no
data-dependent allocation -- so a captured CUDA graph replays it.

The pool row formula is not restated here -- the kernel calls
`pool_index.window_row`, which is what that module exists for.

The `[B,T,W+T]` gather indices the bf16 path uses (`_dspark_block_topk_idxs`)
are a broadcast along T — every draft position attends to the identical set — so
one KV list per request is sufficient here, which is exactly what CSR expresses.
