"""SGLang-style packed compression plan for V4 batched compressor kernels.

Each plan slot is a 16-byte struct of 4 int32 fields:
    [ragged_id, batch_id, position, window_len]

  - ragged_id:  token's row index in the ragged input stream (kv_in / score_in)
  - batch_id:   sequence index (→ state_slot_mapping[batch_id], block_table[batch_id])
  - position:   absolute token position (→ RoPE)
  - window_len: number of leading K-loop iterations that read from state cache
                instead of the ragged input. K = K_pool = (1+overlap)*ratio
                (pool window size — the algorithm constant; distinct from
                STATE_SIZE = K_pool + max_spec_steps which is just the ring
                modulus widened by spec slack).

Two plan tensors are produced per `compress_ratio`:
  - compress_plan: rows for tokens whose `(position+1) % ratio == 0`
                   (= compression boundaries). One row per fused-compress kernel
                   program.
  - write_plan:    rows for tokens whose `position` falls in the per-seq
                   "last K_pool positions" window (the only entries the
                   downstream compressor forward will actually read). One row
                   per `update_compressor_states` kernel program.

Each plan is sliced to a kernel-grid length that depends on the mode: tight
`num_compress` / `num_write` for eager, or a fixed `running_bs * per_seq_bound`
for the decode CUDAGraph path (padding rows sentinel-filled). See
`make_compress_plans` for the exact per-mode capacities.

Caller (per-seq loop) gets `cu_compress_cpu` for slicing the kernel's flat
output `[num_compress, head_dim]` back to per-seq chunks.

                          reconstructs prefix via `context_lens - extend_lens`.
      unique_ratios_overlap: iterable of (ratio, is_overlap) pairs. Typically
                             {(4, True), (128, False)} for V4-Pro; a subset for
                             models with only CSA or only HCA layers.
      plan_buffers: required dict[ratio] -> {"compress": CpuGpuBuffer,
                    "write": CpuGpuBuffer} of pre-allocated fixed-capacity
                    plan buffers. Function writes into the existing buffers
                    and sentinel-fills (-1) trailing rows beyond the actual
                    count, so the returned `compress_plan_gpu` /
                    `write_plan_gpu` views have stable data pointers across
                    calls (CUDAGraph requirement). Fresh per-call alloc is
                    not supported — that pattern caused allocator-churn
                    races (see `write_v4_paged_decode_indices` docstring).
      running_bs: optional int — the CUDAGraph-padded batch size (>= bs). When
                    PROVIDED this selects the DECODE CUDAGraph path: both
                    `compress_plan_gpu` and `write_plan_gpu` are sliced to a
                    FIXED, content-independent capacity `running_bs *
                    per_seq_bound` (compress bound = `ceil(max_q_len / ratio)`;
                    write bound = `min(max_q_len, K_pool)`), and rows
                    `[n_actual, cap)` are sentinel-filled. The cap depends only
                    on `running_bs` and `max_q_len` (both fixed at capture), so
                    capture and replay dispatch identically-shaped kernels; the
                    `[bs, running_bs)` padding seqs land in the sentinel region.
                    `max_q_len` is required when `running_bs` is set. Because the
                    decode write count is EXACTLY `bs * min(qlen, K_pool)`
                    (content-independent), no separate write-capacity dict is
                    needed — the write cap is derived from `running_bs`/`max_q_len`
                    identically to compress.
      max_q_len: optional int — uniform per-seq query length of the padded
                    decode batch (`1 + max_spec_steps`). Required iff `running_bs`
                    is set; used to compute the per-seq compress/write bounds.
      decode_capacity_per_ratio: optional dict[ratio] -> int — explicit FIXED
                    COMPRESS slice length, for CUDAGraph paths whose per-fwd
                    token count is not the uniform `running_bs * max_q_len` shape
                    (the extend-shaped target-verify graph, whose buffers are
                    sized to a dynamic token count). Mutually exclusive with
                    `running_bs`. The write plan then keeps the full-buffer legacy
                    slice (fixed = buffer capacity, sentinel-filled) since that
                    path's write grid is bounded by its buffer sizing.
                    When BOTH this and `running_bs` are None (eager prefill /
                    eager plugin bridges): compress slice = `n_compress` (tight)
                    and write slice = full buffer (legacy). Slices are
                    contiguous-from-base so data pointers stay stable; only
                    `shape[0]` shrinks. Buffers are always sized to the prefill
                    worst case.

    Returns:
      dict[ratio] -> CompressPlan. On empty fwd (`extend_lens_cpu.sum() == 0`)
      still returns CompressPlans pointing at the pre-allocated buffers

      addresses even on a zero-token fwd.
