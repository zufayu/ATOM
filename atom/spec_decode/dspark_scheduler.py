"""DSpark confidence-scheduled verification: Hardware-Aware Prefix Scheduler.

Implements paper Algorithm 1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2026, DSpark §3.2.2): given per-
position confidence scores for a batch of draft blocks and an engine throughput
profile ``SPS(B)``, choose a per-request verification length ``ell_r`` that
maximizes system-wide token throughput ``Theta = tau * SPS(B)``.

Pure, GPU-free, CPU-testable. ``DSparkProposer`` (``dspark_proposer.py``) and
ModelRunner call ``schedule_prefix_lengths`` after computing (and STS-calibrating)
confidence, and truncate each draft block to ``ell_r`` before verification.

Phase-2 scope:
  * ``calibrate_confidence`` — Sequential Temperature Scaling (STS) apply-side.
  * ``schedule_prefix_lengths`` — greedy admission with early-stop (Algorithm 1).
The early-stop ``break`` is a CORRECTNESS guarantee (non-anticipating property,
paper Appendix A), not a perf optimization — see ``_GREEDY_EARLY_STOP``.

    Vectorization insight: survival ``a_{r,j}`` is monotone non-increasing in j

    respects intra-block prefix order. The greedy admission therefore collapses
