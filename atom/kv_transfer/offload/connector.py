"""Public ``lmcache_offload`` connector selection and delegation shell.

The public connector name stays stable while the implementation is selected on
both the scheduler and worker from configuration alone:

* ``dense`` stores ordinary token-indexed KV chunks;
* ``hybrid`` stores DSV4 compressed PAGE chunks plus complete SLOT sidecars;
* ``kimi_k3`` stores dense MLA KV plus a KDA per-request state tier.

Keeping selection config-only is important because the scheduler process does
not have access to the worker's transfer tensors.
