    `thinking: disabled` is answered where the answer costs nothing -- in the
    prompt. The chat template's own switch is set, so the model emits no
    reasoning, so there is none to separate, none to discard, and none for the
    tool parser to misread. This is what SGLang does with the same field and
    what vLLM gets structurally by having no such field at all.

    Everything downstream is then unconditional, which is the point. Three
    attempts to handle an unwanted chain of thought *after* generating it each
    broke something else: discarding it returned an empty message, relabelling
    it as `text` handed the client the thing it declined, and declining to
    separate it fed a chain of thought to the tool parser, which read one
    model's musing about `<function=NAME>` as a call to a tool named `NAME`.
    The reasoning that is never produced needs none of that.

    Only when the field is actually present, which is also what SGLang keys
    on. Anthropic's default is thinking-off, but reading an absent field as
    "switch this model's reasoning off" would silently change what every
    existing caller gets back from a reasoning model. Absent means unstated,
    and unstated leaves the model's own default alone.

    Both directions go through the resolved toggle. Writing a hardcoded
    `thinking=True` for the on direction is a no-op on any template that reads
    another name -- the whole Qwen family -- so an explicit opt-in was
    discarded silently against a server default of off.

    ``toggle`` is ``None`` for a model whose template has no switch. There is
    then nothing to put in the prompt and `anthropic_drop_reasoning` takes
    over.

    Whenever the request did not ask for it. Answering in the prompt is
    strictly better and `anthropic_template_kwargs` does it wherever it can,
    but that only reaches models whose template has a switch -- and it only
    reaches the ones that *asked*, since an absent field leaves the model's
    default alone. This is everything else.

    Withheld, not left unseparated: the reasoning still goes through the
    reasoning filter, so the tool parser never sees a model musing about
    `<function=NAME>` and calls a tool named `NAME`. Only the `thinking`
    blocks are dropped. A response that was *nothing but* reasoning then ends
    on an empty text block, which is the honest answer to "do not think" --
    the previous three attempts to fix this downstream all failed by trying to
    salvage content out of it.

    Absent counts as off *here*, and that is deliberately not what the
    prompt-level answer does. The two are different questions. What to put in
    the prompt is about the model's own default, and overriding a default
    nobody asked about would change what every existing caller gets from a
    reasoning model. What to put in the *response* is about this protocol's
    default, and Anthropic's is thinking-off: a client that never sends the
    field has no reason to expect `thinking` blocks, and one that validates
    block types or verifies the signature rejects them. Reading absent as
    "show it" sent a random-signature `thinking` block to every Claude Code
    and Anthropic-SDK caller talking to a Qwen3 or DeepSeek deployment.

    Separated either way -- only whether the client is *shown* it is decided
    here. That is what keeps a chain of thought out of the tool parser, which
    is a second reader of the same text.
