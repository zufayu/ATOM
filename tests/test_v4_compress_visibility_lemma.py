"""The arithmetic behind dropping `min(per-token, ctx // ratio)`, exhausted.

The V4 index builders used to bound a token's compress-group count twice: by
the token's own position and again by its sequence's context length. The second
bound is dropped on the grounds that it can never be the binding one.

Only those grounds are settled here. Whether every site that applied it was
actually visited is a property of the change, not of anything this file checks
-- it belongs to review and to the commit message, and a test that went looking
for the leftovers would be reading the source it is supposed to be testing.

The grounds are pure arithmetic over two integers, so this file settles them by
enumeration rather than by sampling, and it does so on the CPU with no aiter,
no Triton and no GPU -- which is what lets it run in CI, where every
kernel-vs-reference test in this repo skips itself.

What enumeration CANNOT settle is the premise `pos < ctx`. That is a property
of the code that BUILDS positions, not of the builders that consume them, and
those live in the scheduler, in three metadata paths, and in two out-of-tree
bridges. `test_decode_indptr_qlen_invariance.py` pins the consumer side; the
premise itself is enforced by `require_step_within_full_q`, whose own tests are
at the bottom of this file -- next to the lemma it exists to keep true.
