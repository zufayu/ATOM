"""Which bytes of a KDA Active Slot a checkpoint carries, and where they are.

A K3 checkpoint is a byte copy of one slot into ordinary KV blocks. The slot is
not one range: `mamba_k_cache` and `mamba_v_cache` are both
`(num_layers, num_slots, *state)`, so one slot is `num_layers` strided pieces
per plane. This file covers turning that into an ordered byte stream, pricing
it before the tensors exist, and resolving it to real addresses afterwards.

The builder is exercised through unbound methods on a stub rather than a real
one, which would want a ModelRunner, a model and a GPU. What the stub supplies
is exactly what these methods read, so the arithmetic under test is the shipped
arithmetic.
