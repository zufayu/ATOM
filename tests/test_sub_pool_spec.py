"""Sizing arithmetic for the attention sub-pool specs.

`plan_pools` is the pure half of what used to live inside
`ModelRunner.get_num_blocks()`, which needed a real GPU and so was never
covered. Everything here runs on synthetic specs: no model config is loaded,
so the tests exercise the arithmetic rather than restating a config file.

The central test is `TestParityWithPreSpecArithmetic`, which pins the new
path against the exact expression the runner used before the refactor.
