"""Which bytes of a DeepSeek-V4 Active Slot a checkpoint carries, and that a
store/restore round trip moves exactly those and nothing else.

`checkpoint_ranges_for` (tested in `test_state_arena.py`) says which bytes of the
compressor *arena* are live. This file covers the step after it: composing
those with the sliding-window rows that share the slot, turning the result into
byte segments at a slot's real address, and round-tripping them through the
copy planner.

The stubs here SUBCLASS `DeepseekV4AttentionMetadataBuilder` and skip its
construction, which would want a ModelRunner, a model and a GPU. They supply
state, never behaviour, so the arithmetic under test is the shipped arithmetic
and a method that grows a new dependency is picked up rather than silently
stopping to stand for anything.
